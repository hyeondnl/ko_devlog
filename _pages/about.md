Cognitive computing is supported by machine learning and deep learning technology, which allows computers to autonomously learn from data.<br /><br />
This technology means computers can change and improve their algorithms by themselves, without being explicitly programmed by humans. How does it work? Put simply, if we give the computer a picture of a cat and a picture of a ball, and show it which one is the cat, we can then ask it to decide if subsequent pictures contain cats.
The computer compares other images to its training data set (i.e. the original cat image) and comes up with an answer. Today's machine learning algorithms can do this unsupervised, meaning they do not need their decisions to be pre-programmed. 
The same principle applies to even more complex tasks, albeit with a much larger training set. Google's voice recognition algorithms, for instance, work from a massive training set, but it's still not nearly big enough to predict every possible word phrase or question.<br /><br />

We believe that the technology can make our life better.<br />
