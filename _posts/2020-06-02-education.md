There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor

If you've gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!

As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.


## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

대표적인 분산형 버전 관리 시스템인 Git은 매우 빠르면서도 효율적이고 누구나 자유롭게 코드를 수정하고 배포할 수 있다는 점에서 큰 주목을 받았다. 그러나 부적절한 버전 관리는 오히려 전체적인 개발 흐름을 읽는 데 방해가 되며, 이를 제때 수정하지 않는다면 더 큰 문제가 발생할 수 있다. 

The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. 

An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll... originated with us”. 

> It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. 

The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. 

As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

[코로나 바이러스]() 계열의 변종인 [SARS-CoV-2]()에 의해 발병하는 급성 호흡기 질환으로, 2019년 12월부터 퍼져 지금까지 지속되고 있는 [범유행 전염병]()이자 사람과 동물 모두 감염되는 [인수공통전염병]()이다. 2019년 12월 12일 최초 보고 내용에 따르면, 2019년 12월 1일 중국 후베이성 우한시에서 최초로 발생되었다.


2020년 1월부터 본격적으로 중국에서 외부로 퍼지기 시작해 3월 말까지 일부 국가 및 지역을 제외한 지구상 대부분의 나라와 남극을 제외한 모든 대륙으로 확산되며 많은 감염자와 사망자를 기록했다. [세계보건기구](WHO)는 2020년 1월 31일, 국제적 공중보건 비상사태를 선포했고, 2월 28일부로 코로나바이러스감염증-19의 전 세계 위험도를 '매우 높음'으로 격상하였으며, 3월 11일 코로나바이러스감염증-19가 [범유행전염병]임을 선언했다.


7월 5일 기준으로 전 세계 총 확진자 수는 **1,100만 명**을 돌파하여 11년 전 670만여 명을 감염시켰던 [2009년 인플루엔자 범유행]()의 감염자 수를 압도했으며, 잠정 치사율은 약 4.6%로, 이전에 많은 사람을 죽인 신종플루의 치사율(약 0.3%)보다 약 15배에 달하는 위험한 수치이다. 수많은 유명인들이 감염되거나 사망하면서 전 세계적으로 경각심이 높아졌으며, 정치, 사회, 경제 등 여러 분야에서 큰 영향력을 떨치고 있다.


## 명칭
[세계보건기구]에서 [제네바] 현지 시각으로 2020년 2월 11일 공식 명칭을 **COVID-19**로 확정했으며, 한국에서는 **코로나바이러스감염증-19**(줄여서 코로나19)로 번역했다.
